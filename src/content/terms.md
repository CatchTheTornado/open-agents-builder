## 4.4. AI-GENERATED CONTENT, USER SUBMISSIONS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

1. **AI-Generated Content, Autonomous AI Agents, and Limitations**  
   Our Services include the creation and operation of AI-powered surveys, interactive chats, and multifunctional AI agents that engage with End Users autonomously. These components may generate content automatically using ChatGPT and related large language models, provided by OpenAI and subject to its applicable terms, policies, and usage guidelines. You acknowledge and accept that:

   - **Autonomous Generation:** AI-generated content and interactions‚Äîincluding those produced by AI Agents‚Äîare generated autonomously by machine learning models and may be similar to or identical to content provided to other users. Such content is delivered subject to the terms and restrictions set forth by OpenAI and must be used in accordance with those guidelines.
   - **Lack of Human Oversight:** AI-generated content is produced without human review and may contain errors, misleading information, or biases inherited from its training data. The autonomous nature of these systems means they might misinterpret context, lack emotional nuance, or fail to account for cultural sensitivities, potentially resulting in inaccuracies or unintended outputs.
   - **User Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for reviewing, modifying, and ensuring the accuracy, legality, and suitability of any AI-generated content or autonomous interactions before using them. You are further expected to comply with OpenAI‚Äôs licensing terms and usage policies, ensuring that your use of the Services does not facilitate or promote any prohibited activities.
   - **No Warranties:** We do not guarantee the accuracy, originality, or compliance of AI-generated content or AI agent actions with any legal, regulatory, or ethical standards. All such content and interactions are provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù without any warranties of any kind.
   - **Compliance with OpenAI Policies:** In addition to the terms outlined herein, your use of AI-generated content is governed by and must comply with all relevant OpenAI policies, including restrictions on prohibited content and misuse. Failure to adhere to these policies may result in suspension or termination of access to our Services.

2. **User-Generated Content and Submissions**  
   You may upload, post, or share user submissions (e.g., text, images, data; ‚ÄúUser Submissions‚Äù) through the Services. While we do not claim ownership of your content, by submitting it you:
   - Grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, and process User Submissions for the purpose of operating and improving the Services.
   - Confirm that you own or have the legal right to submit the content.
   - Acknowledge that User Submissions are not confidential, and we are not responsible for their unauthorized access, use, or distribution.
   - Represent that your submissions do not violate any applicable laws, third-party rights, or the terms and conditions established by OpenAI and any other relevant AI service providers.

3. **Content Restrictions, Compliance, and Removal**  
   You may not upload, distribute, or submit any content that infringes on third-party intellectual property rights; is misleading, illegal, or offensive; promotes fraud, violence, or criminal activity; or otherwise violates applicable laws or regulations.

   - We do not actively monitor User Submissions or AI-generated content and disclaim any liability for such content.
   - We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to remove or restrict any User Submission or AI-generated content that violates these terms, with or without notice. If we become aware of information suggesting a criminal offence that threatens the life or safety of any person, we will promptly notify the relevant law enforcement or judicial authorities.
   - Additionally, we may remove unauthorized content at any time or comply with valid legal requests as required by law. If we receive official or credible notice that any data you provide is unlawful, we may disable access to that data.
   - We also provide an easily accessible, user-friendly mechanism that allows any person or entity to report the presence of information within our Services that they consider to be illegal content. Reports should be submitted electronically via the email address provided at **moderation@catchthetornado.com**.

## 4.5. THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS, AI AUTONOMY, AND END USER RESPONSIBILITIES

1. **Third-Party Content and Services:**  
   The Services may include content from third parties and rely on external providers (e.g., APIs, webhooks). We do not guarantee their accuracy, legality, or suitability.  
   You are responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to use any third-party content or services. We are not liable for any damages arising from third-party actions, integrations, or external data transfers.  
   We recommend reviewing and complying with the terms of any third-party service before integrating it with our Services.

2. **AI Autonomy and High-Risk Use Restrictions:**  
   AI agents operate autonomously and may interact with third-party applications beyond direct user control. You acknowledge that AI-generated outputs may be unpredictable, lack loyalty to specific instructions, and integrate with external systems in unintended ways.  
   The Services are not designed for high-risk environments (e.g., emergency services, life-support systems) or for processing sensitive personal data unless explicitly agreed to in writing. Any unauthorized use in such contexts is at your own risk.

3. **End User Responsibilities and Data Handling:**  
   - **Disclosure:** You must inform End Users that surveys, chats, or AI agent interactions may be AI-generated before they engage.
   - **Legal Compliance:** You are responsible for ensuring lawful collection and use of End User data, including obtaining necessary consents under applicable laws.
   - **Data Security:** You must implement appropriate measures to protect collected End User data. We do not claim ownership of End User data but have a license to use it for providing and improving the Services.

Where permitted by applicable law, the right of withdrawal (and any other Consumer-specific rights set out in these terms or under law) will not apply if you are not required to provide any consideration beyond supplying personal data, and that personal data is processed by us solely for performing the agreement with us under these terms or complying with a statutory obligation. This applies, for example, to the basic subscription, which is free of charge and requires only the personal data necessary to provide the Service. Nothing in this clause limits your mandatory legal rights.

## 12.3. RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, AND GOVERNING LAW

- **Assignment:** You may not assign your rights or obligations under these terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations to any third party without restriction.

- **Force Majeure:** Neither party will be liable for delays or failures in performance due to causes beyond reasonable control, such as natural disasters, governmental actions, labor strikes, or internet disruptions. However, this does not relieve you of payment obligations under these terms.
- **Governing Law and Jurisdiction:**
  - **Business users:** These terms are governed by Polish law, and disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Wroclaw, Poland.
  - **Consumers:** Polish law governs these terms, but this does not limit your mandatory rights under applicable local law. The courts in Wroclaw, Poland, will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over disputes brought by Consumers. You also have the option to utilize alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods for handling complaints and claims. ADR procedures are typically voluntary and conducted by independent entities, such as mediators, arbitrators, or consumer ombudsmen. Please note that participation in such procedures may require the consent of both parties involved in the dispute. We encourage you to review the applicable terms and conditions in your country before initiating any ADR process.
