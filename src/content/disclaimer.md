**Detailed Service Disclosure**

1\. Service Overview  
Our Platform enables a client (the Platform User) to create and manage a unique AI agent (with its own URL) using our tool. As an End User, you are provided with access to this service as defined by the Platform User. For comprehensive details on how the service operates, please review our [Terms](https://openagentsbuilder.com/content/terms]

2\. AI Functionality  
The service operates through an AI chat interface powered by OpenAI. Please note that, as with any AI system, outputs may occasionally be imprecise or require human judgment. We act solely as the provider of the technical tool and do not control the specific functions or uses of the AI agent.

3\. Data Processing and Responsibility

* **Our Role**: We facilitate the technical operation of the service by processing the messages exchanged with the AI. Our role in handling your data is limited to ensuring smooth service functionality.  
* **Data Controller**: The Platform User, who creates and deploys the agent, is responsible for collecting and managing any personal data you provide.  
* **Further Details**: For a full explanation of how your data is processed and the rights available to you, please consult our [Data Processing Addendum (DPA)](https://openagentsbuilder.com/content/data-processing) and [Privacy Policy](https://openagentsbuilder.com/content/privacy)
    
4\. User Considerations  

If you have not received sufficient information from the Platform User regarding the management of your personal data, you are encouraged to:  
* Refrain from using the agent, or  
* Withhold any sensitive information and proceed with caution, or  
* Contact us at info@catchthetornado.com for further clarification or to request appropriate actions (e.g., suspension of the Platform Userâ€™s account).  
    
Please review this information carefully to understand the service and your rights before proceeding.
