  ```

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Prefix your commits with:

- `feat:` for new features

- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new agent configuration options"
```

### Pull Requests

- Make sure your changes pass all tests and linters.
- Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch (our nightly/test build).
- Only after integration tests pass, changes will be merged to `main` branch.
