CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CTT projects.

This agreement ensures that any contributions from individuals or organizations are handled in a clear, legal manner. It is designed to protect both you (the contributor) and us (the maintainers of the CTT projects), while not limiting your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

Please read this agreement carefully before signing. Signing this agreement indicates that you understand and agree to the terms below. You retain ownership of your contributions; this agreement simply gives us permission to use and redistribute them as explained here.

Key Definitions

- “CTT”—refers to CT Tornado spółka z o.o., a company duly incorporated and existing under the laws of the Republic of Poland, with its principal place of business in Wroclaw (address: ul. Wyspa Słodowa 7, 50-266 Wroclaw, Poland; registration: District Court for Wroclaw-Fabryczna in Wroclaw, KRS/company no.: 873910; EU VAT no.: PL8982262377; share capital: PLN 5,000.00; email address: info@catchthetornado.com), managing the CTT projects (referred to in this agreement as “we” or “us”). The CTT projects include any software, documentation, or other materials under our stewardship to which you might contribute.
- “You”—refers to the individual contributor or legal entity (company, organization, etc.) who is agreeing to this agreement. If you are a company or organization, You includes any entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with you. (Here, control generally means owning 50% or more of the voting shares or having the authority to direct the management of an entity.)
- “Contribution”—refers to any original work of authorship that you intentionally submit to us for inclusion in any CTT project (for example, source code, patches, documentation, or artwork). This includes any modifications or additions to existing works. For the purposes of this agreement, a contribution is “submitted” when it is sent to us through any communication channel (such as pull requests, patches, emails, or issue tracking systems) for inclusion in a CTT project. Contributions do not include things that you might share but explicitly mark as “Not a Contribution” (for example, general ideas or comments that you do not intend to be governed by this agreement).

Grant of Copyright License

You grant us a broad license to use your Contribution. Specifically, you grant to CTT (and to anyone who uses our projects) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under your copyright in the Contribution to do the following:

- Use and reproduce your Contribution, meaning we can use it and make copies of it as needed.
- Modify your Contribution, i.e. make changes to it or combine it with other materials to create derivative works.
- Distribute your Contribution and any derivative works, which allows us to include your Contribution in the CTT projects and share those projects with others (for example, by releasing software that contains your Contribution).
- Publish, display, or perform your Contribution publicly, for example by displaying it in documentation or running it as part of a demo.
- Sublicense your Contribution, i.e. license it to third parties under our chosen license terms (for example, as part of an open-source project distribution).

This license does not expire, cannot be revoked, and can be terminated upon a 5-year prior notice only when materially breached and not cured promptly. It also applies to any derivative works we create that include your Contribution, so that the project as a whole can be commercialized and distributed under a coherent license or otherwise. In other words, we have the right to use your Contribution as needed in our projects, and to allow others to use it, without needing further permission from you.

At the same time, you still keep all your ownership rights in your Contribution, and you are free to use or license your own work to anyone else as you wish.

If applicable law grants you any “moral rights” in the Contribution (such as the right to be credited or to object to modifications), you agree not to assert those rights against us or our licensees, to the extent necessary for us to exercise the rights granted above. This means, for example, that we may include your Contribution in our projects without always having to list you as an author, and we may modify or redistribute it as needed.

Grant of Patent License

If you hold any patent rights that would read on (apply to) your Contribution or its combination with any CTT project, you also grant us (and our users) a patent license. That means you grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under those patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contribution as part of the CTT projects. This patent license extends to the Contribution itself and any larger work that your Contribution becomes a part of. It covers only the patent claims you can license that would be infringed by using your Contribution on its own or combined with the project. In simpler terms, if your Contribution or its integration into our project practices any of your patent claims, you’re giving us and users permission to do so.

Patent litigation clause: If any person or company (including you, or any entity affiliated with you) files a patent lawsuit alleging that your Contribution, or the combination of your Contribution with a CTT project, infringes their patent, then any patent licenses you granted under this agreement to that party will terminate immediately as of the date such a lawsuit is filed. In other words, if you (or your company) sue anyone over patent claims related to the code you contributed, this patent license to that suing party ends. This clause is intended to protect the project and its users from patent litigation threats.

Your Representations and Commitments

By signing this agreement, you make the following promises and assurances about your Contribution:

- You have the right to grant these licenses. You guarantee that you developed the Contribution yourself or otherwise have the necessary rights to submit it. If your Contribution includes or is based on work done by anyone else (including your employer or other authors), you confirm that you have authorization to include that work and to grant us the licenses described in this agreement. This means, for example, that if you wrote the code as part of your job, either your employer has permitted you to contribute this code (e.g. through a prior agreement or policy), or your employer has signed its own CLA with us, or your employer has waived any rights it may have in your Contribution. If part of your Contribution is taken from a third-party source (open-source code, etc.), that code must be under a compatible license that allows you to include it and sublicense it to us, or you must have obtained explicit permission from the owner.
- Your Contribution is your original work (to the best of your knowledge). You confirm that you did not plagiarize or copy someone else’s work in your Contribution without proper authority. If any portion of the Contribution is not originally written by you, you have identified it clearly (for example, in the submission or source code comments) and you have verified that it is licensed in a way that allows us to use and redistribute it as part of our projects.
- No conflicts or restrictions. To the best of your knowledge, your Contribution does not violate any other agreement or legal obligation. For example, you aren’t knowingly breaching a contract or court order by contributing your work, and you aren’t misusing anyone’s confidential information or trade secrets. You also represent that your Contribution does not include or rely on code or materials under copyleft or other licenses that might impose additional restrictions on the CTT projects—for example, by requiring the distribution of source code or dictating specific terms for onward licensing.
- Authority to sign for your organization (if applicable). If you are signing this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (rather than as an individual), you have the legal authority to bind that organization to the terms of this agreement. You also ensure that all contributions submitted by that organization’s employees or contractors are done with the organization’s knowledge and permission under these same terms.
- Support and maintenance. You understand that you are not obligated to provide support, updates, or bug fixes for your Contribution, and we have no duty to do so either. Of course, you may choose to help maintain your Contribution as part of the project, but that is voluntary. Once you submit the Contribution, we may decide to use it or not use it in a CTT project at our discretion. We have no obligation to include your Contribution in any product or project release.
- Contribution is provided “as is”. Except as stated in this agreement, you are not making any warranties about your Contribution.

Finally, you agree to notify us promptly if you become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of your representations above untrue or inaccurate. For example, if you discover that part of your Contribution actually belonged to someone else or was patented by someone, you will let us know so that we can address the issue.

Miscellaneous

This agreement is governed by the laws of Poland, excluding its conflict-of-law principles. If any part of this agreement is deemed unenforceable, the remaining clauses remain in full force. Any disputes arising from or related to this agreement will be resolved exclusively by the common courts having jurisdiction over our principal place of business.

We may assign this agreement and all its rights and obligations to any affiliate or successor entity. You may not assign this agreement without prior written consent from us, except if your entity merges with or transfers substantially all its assets to another organization. You will promptly notify us of such an event.
