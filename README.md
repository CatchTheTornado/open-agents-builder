## Making the **Enterprise** Hackers and Business users worlds met.

### Hackers?

Design the flows visually and then integrate it via API with your existing apps or generate the TypeScript code for [flows-ai](https://github.com/callstackincubator/flows-ai)

## API Client

We provide an API client to interact with Open Agents Builder. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/open-agents-builder-client). Additionally, there is an example project demonstrating how to use the API client available [here](https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/open-agents-builder-example).

To use the API client, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install open-agents-builder-client zod
```

Here is a basic example of how to use the API client:

```javascript
import { OpenAgentsBuilderClient } from "open-agents-builder-client";

const client = new OpenAgentsBuilderClient({
    baseUrl: "https://app.openagentsbuilder.com",  // optional, defaults to this if omitted
    databaseIdHash: process.env.DATABASE_ID_HASH ?? '',  // optional, defaults to this if omitted
    apiKey: process.env.OPEN_AGENTS_BUILDER_API_KEY ?? ''  // required
});

client.agent.listAgents().then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
});
```

## Use Cases 

Open Agents Builder is a very simple tool you can run on your own or use the [hosted version](https://openagentsbuilder.com). 

### E-commerce

You may list your products (with prices, variants, photos) and let the users configure and select what they're interested in. The agent will gather all required data, maintain the shopping cart and finalize with order!

### Made to Order, CPQ

Complex products are very difficult for users to configure. You may create an agent which is instructed how to configure the products based on even super-complex specs. Let it do the work for your users and for you - finalizing with a Quote or an Order!

### Booking

Use the Calendar module to let the users sign up for your services finding the most convinient time slots. Collect leads!

### Pre-visit inquiries

Share the link of the Agent with your patient/customers no matter if you are a medicine doctor either physio-terapist, trainer etc. The results will let you **save tons of time** preparing for the visit.

### Scheduling 

Tired of using **Calendly** or **Cal.com**? Send them the agent which will let the users schedule calls with you based on your availability + already scheduled events.

### Collecting user feedback

Add a widget to your website with a link to Agent which will ask 2-3 questions to get the users feedback, notify you on e-mail once they got it and store in a database for further analytics.

### NPS and e-NPS

Agent Doogle is great for checking the Net Promoter Score. Create an Agent, send a link to your employees (eNPS) or customers (NPS) - use the "Chat with the results" feature to calculate the NPS dynamically on the spot!

### Supporting users

Automatically answer all the users questions + use the event based actions to react for business critical situations (like potential lead etc)

## Getting started

Open Agents Builder has literally no external dependencies. If you like to run it locally or **contribute** please just execute the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/open-agents-builder
cd open-agents-builder
```

> **Note:** For development, please use the `develop` branch which is our nightly/test build. The `main` branch is reserved for stable releases and hotfixes. All pull requests should be targeted to `develop` branch.

Install required dependencies: `poppler` and `markitdown`:

```bash
pip install markitdown
pip install poppler-utils
```
or - install `pipx` using `brew install pipx` (on Mac) or `apt-get install pipx` (on Debian) for managing your defualt Python 3 env automatically, and run:

```bash
pipx install markitdown
pipx install poppler
```


Now, edit the `ENV` variables:

```bash
cp .env.defaults .env.local
```

Edit the `.env.local` file:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o

# OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Resend.com API key
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Vector store engine (sqlite or disk, defaults to sqlite)
VECTOR_STORE_ENGINE=sqlite

# absoulte app url starting with http://
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3000 # 3002 is prod app port
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@.... # accordingly to your Resend.com settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=dev
```

Run the app!

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

That's it! Now you can get open your browser and navigate to: https://localhost:3000

## Ollama Integration
Open Agents Builder supports Ollama as an alternative LLM provider to OpenAI. Allowing you to run Ollama models on your own infrastructure.
### Configuration
To use Ollama with Open Agents Builder, set the following environment variables in `.env.local`:
```bash
# Select Ollama as the LLM provider
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama

# Set the Ollama API endpoint (default for local installation)
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434/api

# Specify which model to use (defaults to llama3.1 if not specified)
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1
```
Ensure that the `OLLAMA_URL` is set to `<base-url>/api` so that the correct endpoints for Ollama are used.

## Gmail Integration Setup

To enable Gmail functionality in your agents, you need to set up OAuth2 credentials:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API for your project
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Application type: Web application
   - Authorized redirect URIs: Add `http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/oauth/callback` (for development)
   - For production, add your production callback URL

5. Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/oauth/callback
```

Note: For production, make sure to:
- Update the `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` to your production callback URL
- Keep your client secret secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider using environment-specific configuration for development and production
